This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) designed to retrieve information about GitHub users. It consists of two main pages.

On the first page, there's an input field where users can type a name. After receiving a response from the server, the application displays all user matches with the typed string, or provides appropriate feedback if there are no matches. Each user's card includes an option to add the user to favorites.

The second page, called 'Favorites,' allows users to view all the users they have added to their favorites list.
